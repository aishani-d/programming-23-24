## Format Strings 
We can evaluate inside of strings using *f-strings.*
To create an f-string, we put an `f` before the opening quote.

```python
fave_food = input("What's your favourite food? ")
print(f"Ooooo, {fave_food} sounds good!")
```

# String Methods 

[[Methods]] are functions that we can use on [[Objects]].

String methods allow us to modify and work with strings.

Say, for example, we want to make all characters of a string lowercase.

```python
mrubial_yelling = "PLEASE PUSH IN YOUR CHAIRS"

print(mrubial_yelling.lower()) # lowercases the letters
```

### `.lower()`

The `.lower()` method takes a string and converts all UPPERCASE characters to lowercase.

We can use `.lower()` to help with [[Errors#Semantic Errors|errors]]  

### `.upper()`

The `.upper()` method converts all lowercase characters to uppercase in a string.

### `.strip(str)`

The `.strip()` method removes characters from the beginning and end of the string.

```python
user_feeling = input("How are you feeling? ")

# "good" "Good" "GOOD" "GOOD!" "good." "good?"
if user_feeling.lower().strip("!.,?") == "good":
	print("That's great!")
```

## `.split(str) -> List`

The `.split()` method splits a string into a [[List]], separating the string based on the characters you give it.

```python
grocery_str = "eggs milk cheese hotwheels"

grocery_list = grocery_str.split(" ")
```
