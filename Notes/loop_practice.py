# Create a list of groceries 
groceries = ["hot wheels", "lego", "ice cream", "video games"]

# Do something for each thing in the list
# Print it out in a pretty way
#   e.g.    * hot wheels
#           ---
#           * lego
#           ---

for item in groceries:
    print(f"* {item}")
    print("  ---")

# Create a pyramid like this using a for loop

# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****

stars = ["*", "**", "***", "****", "*****"]

for row in stars:
    print(row)

# Problem:
# Create a new years eve countdown
# Requirements:
#   * Starts off at 10
#   * Countdown every second and print the second that it's at
#   * Instead of reaching zero it says "Happy New Year"
# Example Output:
#   10
#   9
#   8
#   ...
#   1
#   Happy New Year!

countdown = ["10", "9", "8", "7", "6", "5", "4", "3", "2", "1", "Happy New Year!"]

for row in countdown:
    print(row)
